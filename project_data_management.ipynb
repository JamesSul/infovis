      "## Olympic data management steps\n",
      "This is a quick walkthrough of how I would handle managing the data for this assignment using the tool I normally use for this at work -- Python. Before we get too far into this, I want to define the datasets and sources I will be using. This whole walkthrough shows a lot of code which you can ignore if it makes no sense to you. The steps I'm taking conceptually might help you with your own assignments and I will talk about how I might do some of this in Excel.\n",
      "\n",
      "*note: this is not a tutorial, nor is it an introduction to python. The purpose is two-fold: first, to show you some of the steps involved in preparing data for visualization; second, to show you how much quicker data management is if you know a programming language like Python. Do not try to install python*\n",

      "I will use the following datasets:\n",
      "\n",
      "* HistoricWinterOlympicMedals.csv - I simply saved the Excel file from the assignment as a csv file.\n",
      "* OlympicMedalsbyEvent2014.csv - saved to csv from Excel as well.\n",
      "* olympic_medals_2010.csv - I scraped this from [this wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics_medal_table)\n",
      "* country_codes.csv - for converting olympic IOC country codes to the ISO3 country codes used by the World Bank ([scraped from here](http://data.okfn.org/data/country-codes))\n",
      "* noclist.csv - a list of country noc codes and their names ([scraped from wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOC_country_codes))\n",
      "* the [World Bank Data API](http://data.worldbank.org/developers) for directly getting data from the world bank. I'm actually using the wbdata library for this and will get annual population data by country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, I want to export a csv file to use in Tableau that has country, noc(the national olympic committee code for that country), year, medal (i.e., gold, silver, bronze), count of medal, and population.\n",
      "\n",
      "In step 1, I am simply importing the libraries I'm going to use. Pandas is a Python library that allows me to work with data in a dataframe (think of a spreadsheet). Numpy is a scientific library that I'll use for some data structure conversion and melt allows me to transform the data. Each \"step\" is labeled as in for input. Step 1 has no Excel equivalent."

I am performing another sanity check here because I know, over time, countries change. For example, there is no more Soviet Union and we now have Mother Russia (or Russia and Crimea).
